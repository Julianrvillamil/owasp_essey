		<h2>OWASP and its importance to Application Security</h2>
		<span class="author">By: Julian Arturo Roa Villamil | ID: 0000195062 | Date: 26/02/2022 </span>
		<p>The Open Web Application Security Project is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving software security by providing the necessary resources to each developer or people who are dedicated to managing the security of applications, such as mobile applications, web services and everything that is related to or includes the part of technological structures in order to guarantee or minimally mitigate the risks and vulnerabilities that they are mostly presented in the security industry and therefore caused by cybercriminals or attackers who try to violate the security of the systems. Basically OWASP, is a non-profit foundation which provides us with the necessary tools to be able to defend ourselves against computer attackers who want to take advantage of a security breach.</p>
		<p>To do all of this, OWASP, basically works with a series of sponsors who provide the necessary financing for the project to continue operating. In addition to this, there is also a very huge community behind OWASP made up of various people, some dedicated exclusively to the world of development, others dedicated exclusively to the strengthening of technological infrastructures and above all the community of everything that the technology environment involve.</p>
		<p>Some important guidelines that OWASP has is the safe development of software, from its inception to its production, for this OWASP has various guides that allow us to have a reference of this. It is not focused directly on the design, but rather on hardening the backend and the purpose of these guidelines is to give us as developers the main security risks and mistakes so as not to commit them. Apart from this, the number of resources that OWASP can provide to a development team, or a security team is very wide and above all, free.</p>

		<p>Some of the main projects, guides or articles that OWASP offers us are the Juice shop, vulnerable applications on which you can work finding vulnerabilities, mobile security testing guides, Rules for ModSecurity, Guides for web security tests the Zed Attack Proxy, which allows us to intercept requests and work with attacks, header modifications and detect vulnerabilities, but one that stands out is the OWASP TOP 10 or the top 10 vulnerabilities, which presents us with a list of the 10 risks that mostly occur in the development of applications and despite the fact that the list is regularly updated, it is not a recent project, it has been on the market for many years and above all it is worked on by people who are dedicated to security, people who have the experience and meet to evaluate these risks and be able to give them a priority or category in terms of the level of frequency with which they appear in the applications. But something that leaves me thinking is about the capacity that attackers have with this information, if they know the biggest vulnerabilities it is obvious that they are going to exploit them.</p>
		<p>Another very interesting project is the OWASP testing guide, which is basically a guide of more than 600 pages in which OWASP goes, one by one, of all the vulnerabilities that have been identified in web applications so that we are already developers or security managers we check each of the vulnerabilities to ensure that our web application is not affected by any vulnerability. An extremely valuable resource because it not only says what vulnerability it is, but also dictates the different steps to test it and not only test it but test it in 3 different areas, in black box tests, in gray box tests and in tests from White box. More specifically these tests try to test how secure a web application is against different types of hackers, for example the black box tests are designed considering an external hacker without knowledge of the application and how he could find vulnerabilities in the application, gray box tests would consider a hacker with some knowledge of the applications and how he could find vulnerabilities, this partial knowledge of the hacker would come to be the knowledge of external frameworks, when certain names of the internal organization or certain internal information of the organization are known. organization that can be used to search for web application vulnerabilities and finally there would be the White box tests, which consist of giving information to the pentester or ethical hacker who is doing the tests about how the application is built in all its phases, such as source code or libraries used, here's the idea is that the greatest amount of information is included so that the greatest number of vulnerabilities can be identified, normally the attacker would not have this amount of information, however, the idea of doing it this way is that the vulnerabilities that even attackers can find they could not even find or at least find in a reasonable time.</p>	
		<p>In conclusion, OWASP provides us with extremely important documentation and tools to maintain security in our web applications, from keeping us updated on which vulnerabilities are currently the most exploited to providing us with documentation and tools to find vulnerabilities in different situations, however, and like all valuable information, can be seen as a double-edged sword, because this information and tools would also be available to attackers, but despite all this, there are more pros than cons when implementing the supplied documentation by OWASP since, as mentioned in the testing gide, different attack scenarios can even be tested, since OWASB provides us with a way to carry out the tests for each of these modalities, which, despite the information provided to attackers, could mitigate the range of the attacks themselves and if it cannot be mitigated also in It indicates that another path could be taken to remedy that problem and thus provide much more robust security.</p>
